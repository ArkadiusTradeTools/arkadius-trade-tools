# Arkadius' Trade Tools Exports for Elder Scrolls Online

## Running exports
After saving an export within ESO, you can generate a CSV file from your system by running the `run-export.bat` file in the root of the addon.

## Options
The export script supports two option flags, but more may be added in the future:

`--latest`: Automatically picks the newest saved export for generation.

`--members`: Includes only guild members when generating the export file.
